## 📖 Project Overview
**BudgetSU** is a mobile application that empowers university students to track, analyze, and visualize their daily expenses — while distinguishing between **on-campus** and **off-campus** spending.

The app leverages geolocation and budget visualization to show users how their money flows across different contexts.  
With instant analytics and a clean interface, BudgetSU encourages financial awareness and smarter daily decisions.

---

## 🎯 Problem & Solution

### ❌ The Problem
Students often struggle to manage personal finances because they:
- Lack awareness of where their money is spent (especially small daily purchases),
- Don’t separate necessary (on-campus) and optional (off-campus) expenses,
- Have no quick visual summary of budget progress.

### ✅ The Solution
BudgetSU provides a **real-time expense tracking and visualization system**.  
It automatically detects if a transaction occurred inside or outside the campus using GPS geofencing, then categorizes and visualizes it instantly through charts and dashboards — helping users stay within their daily, weekly, or monthly budget.
